### Problem Statement

`In 2020, covid hit the world, and we have x-ray images of the chest region and we want to be able to easily detect covid and its difference from pnemonia`

### Dataset

`https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amanullahasraf/covid19-pneumonia-normal-chest-xray-pa-dataset/data`

### Decision

1.  What kind of model do we use to train and why
2.  Cleaning and preparation of data
3.  Differences and relationships between data (showing graphs) - (Zhang)
4.  Training of data (victor)
5.  Inference (show graphs and accuracy) (yuan)
6.  Integrate with open cv (liu & Yao)
7.  Pratical use (phone application uses our model) (liu & Yao)

`Accuracy: 88.98%
Precision: 89.55%
Recall: 88.98%
F1 Score: 89.02%
Confusion Matrix:

 [ 39 418   7]
 [ 16  60 388]]`

## To Run the Project

#### To Run the Project on Mobile

Install the android apk on your phone and scan x-ray images [Download X-ray Detector Android App](https://expo.dev/artifacts/eas/xkhSvmGsrMQyzcvhCLc3jc.apk)

#### To Run the Project without Mobile Application

> Watch the video we've preprared and use the api [API FOR PREDICTING X-RAY](https://ec2-16-170-250-17.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com/predict)
